# Rocket Pants!

This is where the readme shall go. Seriously.

## Using with Rspec

Simply include RocketPants::TestHelper and RocketPants::RSpecMatchers, and you'll get access to:

* `be_singular_resource`
* `be_collection_resource`
* `be_paginated_response`
* `be_api_error(type = any)`
* `have_exposed(data)`

and helpers for checking data.
